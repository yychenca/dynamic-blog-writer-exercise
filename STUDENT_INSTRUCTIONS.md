# AI Agents Capstone Project: Student Instructions

## üéØ Project Overview

Welcome to your **AI Agents Capstone Project**! You'll be building a sophisticated multi-agent system that creates blog posts automatically. This project demonstrates everything you've learned about AI agents, the ReAct framework, and agentic workflows.

### What You're Building

A **Dynamic Blog Writer** system with 5 specialized agents:
1. **üé≠ Persona Architect** - Creates writer personas and search strategies
2. **üîç Research Analyst** - Conducts web research and gathers information  
3. **‚úçÔ∏è Content Synthesizer** - Writes blog posts based on persona and research
4. **üîç Critic** - Evaluates drafts against quality principles
5. **‚úèÔ∏è Editor** - Manages iterative improvement workflow

This implements the **Evaluator-Optimizer** pattern you learned about in [Session 3](session_course_notes.html)!

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Completed Session 1 (Prompt Engineering)
- Completed Session 2 (RAG)
- Completed Session 3 (AI Agents)
- Basic Python knowledge
- Gemini API key (free from https://ai.google.dev/)

### Setup Instructions

#### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
1. **Open the notebook**: Upload `agent_capstone_exercises.ipynb` to Google Colab or open directly
2. **Add API Key Secret**:
   - Click the üîë key icon in the left sidebar
   - Add new secret: `GEMINI_API_KEY` 
   - Paste your API key from https://ai.google.dev/
   - **Important**: Enable "Notebook access" for this secret
3. **Run Setup**: Execute all setup cells in order (they'll install packages automatically)
4. **Start Exercises**: Begin with Exercise 1

#### Option 2: Local Development (VS Code, Cursor, PyCharm, etc.)

**Step 1: Project Setup**
```bash
# Clone or download the project files
# Navigate to the project directory
cd path/to/BlogWriterExercise
```

**Step 2: Install Dependencies**
```bash
# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Alternative: Install packages individually
pip install google-generativeai beautifulsoup4 requests jupyter ipykernel
```

**Step 3: Set Up API Key (Choose one method)**

**Method A: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
```bash
# Linux/Mac
export GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# Windows (Command Prompt)
set GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here

# Windows (PowerShell)
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
```

**Method B: VS Code Settings**
```json
// In your workspace settings.json
{
    "terminal.integrated.env.linux": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key_here"
    },
    "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key_here"
    },
    "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
        "GEMINI_API_KEY": "your_actual_api_key_here"
    }
}
```

**Method C: .env file (Optional)**
```bash
# Create .env file in project root
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
```

**Step 4: Launch Jupyter**
```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook agent_capstone_exercises.ipynb

# Or use Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab agent_capstone_exercises.ipynb
```

**Step 5: Verify Setup**
- Run the first few cells to verify everything works
- The configuration cell will prompt for API key if not found in environment

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### API Key Problems
- **Issue**: `GEMINI_API_KEY not found`
- **Solution**: Double-check you've set the environment variable or Colab secret correctly
- **Test**: In a Python cell, run `import os; print(os.environ.get('GEMINI_API_KEY'))` (should not show None)

#### Package Installation Issues
```bash
# If packages fail to install
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt

# For specific import errors
pip install --upgrade google-generativeai
```

#### Jupyter Notebook Issues
```bash
# If kernel doesn't start
jupyter kernelspec list
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=python3

# Restart Jupyter after installing packages
```

#### VS Code Jupyter Issues
- Install the Jupyter extension for VS Code
- Select the correct Python interpreter (Ctrl+Shift+P ‚Üí "Python: Select Interpreter")
- Restart VS Code after installing packages

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Guide

### Code Structure

Each exercise follows this pattern:
1. **Class Definition**: Pre-built class with method signatures
2. **TODO Sections**: Clearly marked areas for your implementation
3. **Hints**: Guidance on what to implement
4. **Test Assertions**: Automatic validation of your work

### Working with TODOs

Look for these patterns in the code:
```python
# TODO: Write your prompt here
# HINT: Include these specific elements...
prompt = f"""
# Your implementation goes here
"""

# TODO: Make the API call
response = None  # Replace with actual call
```

### Getting Help

1. **Read the Hints**: Each TODO has specific hints about what to implement
2. **Review Course Notes**: Refer back to `session_course_notes.html`
3. **Check Assertions**: Error messages will guide you to what's missing
4. **Study Examples**: The notebook includes example data and expected formats

---

## ‚úÖ Validation and Testing

### Exercise Completion Checks

Each exercise has built-in assertions that will:
- ‚úÖ Verify your implementation works
- ‚úÖ Check output formats and types
- ‚úÖ Validate integration with other components
- ‚ùå Show specific error messages if incomplete

### Success Indicators

You'll know you're succeeding when you see:
- `‚úÖ Exercise X completed successfully!`
- No assertion errors when running cells
- Realistic output from your agents

### Final Integration Test

Once all exercises are complete, run the final integration test to see your complete multi-agent system in action!

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### API Key Problems
**Issue**: `GEMINI_API_KEY not found`
**Solution**: Make sure you've added the API key to Colab secrets or environment variables

### JSON Parsing Errors
**Issue**: `JSONDecodeError when parsing response`
**Solution**: Clean the response text by removing ```json``` markers before parsing

### Import Errors
**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError`
**Solution**: Run the package installation cell at the top of the notebook

### Empty Search Results
**Issue**: Web search returns no results
**Solution**: This is normal sometimes - your code should handle empty results gracefully

### Agent Communication Issues
**Issue**: Agents can't communicate with each other
**Solution**: Make sure you're returning the correct data types (PersonaResult, ResearchResult, etc.)

---

## üí° Tips for Success

### Start Simple
- Implement basic functionality first
- Add error handling after core logic works
- Test each exercise before moving to the next

### Use the Course Concepts
- Think about **Thought ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Observation** for each agent
- Remember the **Evaluator-Optimizer** pattern for the review loop
- Apply **prompt engineering** techniques from Session 1

### Debug Effectively
- Print intermediate results to understand what's happening
- Check the assertions carefully - they tell you exactly what's expected
- Use the sample data provided to test your implementations

### Be Patient with API Calls
- Gemini API calls can take a few seconds
- Web searches may occasionally fail - this is normal
- Don't worry if you need multiple attempts to get it right
